      <h3>Research topics</h3> <br>
        <b>Learning of complex representations</b> | How do we learn complex networks that surround us? We use tools from
        network science, applied topology and deep learning to understand the process of learning of complex (spatial and non-spatial)
        representations of the world. <br><br>
        <b>Reorganization of brain networks</b> | What rules govern constant changes in brain network configuration?
        We use network neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques to study the dynamics of functional brain networks
        during cognitive tasks and learning. <br><br>
        <b>Dynamics of brain-body interaction</b> | How our body interacts with the brain network? We want to understand
        interactions between brain and body during cognition. <br> <br>
        <b>Creative flow and art perception </b> | What are neuronal mechanisms of creative process in humans? Why art
        play so important role in human lives? We seek to understand how brain-body interaction shapes the creative flow
        and art perception.
